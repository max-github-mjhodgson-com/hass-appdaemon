# hass-appdaemon
This is a repo for my Home Assistant Appdaemon Python code.
I don't use many automations in the Home Assistant Frontend. 99% of my automations are in Appdaemon (due to the complexity).

Areas covered are Grandstream doorphone, CCTV, House Mode, Garage, Calendar, Kitchen and Car (using Fordpass).
